A simple game to learn pygame

### A note to onlookers:
This is not (and is not intended to be) a mature project. It does no follow many well-established Python or OOP guidelines.

I am doing this as an exercise in building a simple game and learn how pygame works. 
I may go back and refactor when I'm done just to calm down my own ick-factor, but making it pretty was never a goal.
