# py-invaders
A simple game to learn pygame

### A note to onlookers:
This is not (and is not intended to be) a mature project. It is mainly a training ground for `pygame` and, as such, I may take shortcuts in implementation and documentation. I will try to keep the code as clean as possible, but I will not be too concerned with the quality of the code. I will, however, try to keep the code as readable as possible.
